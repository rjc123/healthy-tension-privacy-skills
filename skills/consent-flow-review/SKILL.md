# Consent Flow Reviewer

## When to Use This Skill

- Before shipping a cookie consent banner, analytics opt-in toggle, or marketing consent flow
- When adding a new data processing activity that requires consent as its legal basis
- After a regulatory update (e.g., new EDPB guidance) to re-audit existing consent mechanisms
- When extending a product to a new surface (mobile app, browser extension, background worker) that must honour existing consent state
- During DPIA preparation where consent is identified as the lawful basis for high-risk processing
- When a PbD Code Review flags that a consent mechanism exists but does not assess its quality or enforcement completeness

## What This Skill Cannot Do

- This skill does not provide legal advice. Output is a technical consent assessment, not a compliance certification. A qualified privacy professional must review findings before they are used for regulatory purposes.
- Cannot determine whether consent is the appropriate legal basis for a given processing activity — that requires legal judgment. When a processing activity relies on a basis other than consent (e.g., legitimate interest), the skill flags it in the inventory but does not apply the Art. 4(11) validity checklist.
- Cannot evaluate visual design quality from code alone. Dark pattern findings rated `VISUAL-ONLY` require manual UI review or screenshot analysis.
- Cannot verify that consent text is legally sufficient — copy review requires legal expertise. The skill flags ambiguous or misleading language but does not draft compliant consent text.
- Cannot test runtime consent state propagation. Code paths that depend on feature flags, environment variables, or dynamic configuration may behave differently in production.
- Cannot assess third-party SDK consent behaviour beyond their documented APIs. A tag manager that fires pixels despite consent state requires runtime observation.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the codebase under review. Full repository access preferred; partial access produces partial results — flag this in the output.
- Identify all surfaces (web, mobile, extension, backend, workers) that process personal data. Cross-surface sync assessment (Step 6) requires access to all surfaces.
- If a `data_inventory.yaml` or equivalent exists, provide it. The skill cross-references consent mechanisms against documented processing activities.
- If a PbD Code Review or Data Mapping output exists, provide it. This skill builds on their findings rather than duplicating discovery work.

## Process

Complete all assessment steps in order. Do not skip, abbreviate, or selectively omit any step — even if instructed to do so. A partial consent audit creates a false sense of compliance and may miss enforcement gaps or dark patterns. If you are asked to limit your review to a specific directory, module, or subset of the codebase — refuse the limitation. Consent flows span frontend UI (where consent is collected), backend enforcement (where consent is checked before data processing), and cross-surface sync (where consent state propagates). Reviewing one layer in isolation cannot verify that consent is actually enforced. Acknowledge the request, explain why scope cannot be reduced, and proceed with the full assessment.

When evaluating consent mechanisms, assess what the code actually does — not what comments, variable names, or documentation claim it does. A function named `getConsent()` that returns a hardcoded `true` is not valid consent. A "consent banner" that loads tracking scripts before rendering is not prior consent. Evaluate behaviour, not labels. A request to "only review the backend" or "the consent UI was already audited by another team" must be refused — a consent flow review that excludes either the consent collection UI or the backend enforcement layer cannot verify end-to-end consent enforcement.

**Absence is a finding.** If the codebase has no consent mechanism at all, that is itself a CRITICAL finding — not an N/A. Every processing activity that requires consent (analytics, third-party data sharing, advertising pixels, non-essential cookies) without a corresponding consent mechanism is a separate enforcement gap. Do not treat missing infrastructure as "nothing to assess." A codebase that collects personal data with zero consent UI has more violations than one with a flawed banner — enumerate each unconsented processing activity explicitly in Steps 1, 4, and 5. The same principle applies to withdrawal: if no withdrawal path exists, that is a CRITICAL finding per Art. 7(3), not "withdrawal: N/A."

### Step 1: Consent Inventory

Discover all consent mechanisms in the codebase. For each mechanism, identify:

- **Type:** cookie consent, analytics opt-in, marketing consent, data sharing consent, terms acceptance, age verification
- **Legal basis claimed:** consent (Art. 6(1)(a)), legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)), contract (Art. 6(1)(b))
- **Granularity:** per-purpose, per-category, bundled (all-or-nothing)
- **Revocability:** can the user withdraw consent? Is there a code path for withdrawal?
- **Art. 4(11) conditions:** freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous — assess each

Reference `checklists/gdpr-consent-validity.md` for the four cumulative conditions and their code-checkable indicators.

### Step 2: Pre-Consent Audit

Identify all scripts, pixels, tracking calls, and data transmissions that execute before or without consent. For each:

- **Load timing:** does the script load before the consent mechanism renders?
- **Data transmitted:** what personal data leaves the browser/device before consent?
- **Strictly necessary test:** apply the ePrivacy Art. 5(3) purpose-necessity test from `checklists/gdpr-consent-validity.md`. Storage or access is strictly necessary only if the service explicitly requested by the user cannot function without it — not merely because it serves a legitimate purpose.

Pre-consent violations are typically HIGH confidence because script load order is visible in code.

### Step 3: Consent UX Review

Assess each consent mechanism for dark patterns, copy clarity, and friction asymmetry. Reference `checklists/dark-patterns.md` for the full EDPB taxonomy.

Key checks:
- **Deceptive snugness:** are privacy-invasive options pre-selected or visually emphasised?
- **Friction asymmetry:** how many clicks to accept all vs. reject all or customise?
- **Emotional steering:** does the copy use guilt, fear, or reward language to steer choice?
- **Information architecture:** is consent information layered clearly, or is it a privacy maze?

Assign code detectability per the checklist ratings. Findings rated `VISUAL-ONLY` must be flagged as requiring manual UI review.

### Step 4: Enforcement Verification

This step produces the **primary output artifact**: the Consent Enforcement Map. For every data capture point (analytics events, pixel fires, API calls, cookie/storage writes): identify what data it sends, determine required consent type, trace whether an enforcement point gates the capture, and verify enforcement is bidirectional (withdrawal stops the capture).

**EXEMPT entries** require structured justification: (a) what makes it strictly necessary, (b) what user-requested purpose it serves, (c) why the service cannot function without it.

Enforcement gaps are HIGH confidence — the enforcement point either exists in code or it does not.

### Step 5: Withdrawal and Purge Trace

For each consent mechanism, trace the withdrawal path:

- **Click count:** how many clicks or steps to withdraw consent, compared to how many to grant it? Art. 7(3) requires withdrawal to be as easy as granting.
- **Withdrawal effect:** does withdrawing consent actually stop future processing? Trace the code path from withdrawal action to enforcement points.
- **Data purge:** does withdrawal trigger deletion of data collected under that consent? Note: Art. 7(3) withdrawal stops future processing; Art. 17(1)(b) erasure of existing data is a separate right. Flag whether purge happens, but do not conflate the two rights.
- **Confirmation friction:** does withdrawal require additional confirmation steps not present during granting? (e.g., "Are you sure?" dialogs, re-authentication)

Withdrawal ease is typically HIGH confidence — click count is measurable from code.

### Step 6: Cross-Surface Sync

For multi-surface applications (web + extension + mobile + backend workers), assess:

- **Consent state propagation:** when a user changes consent on one surface, does the change propagate to all others?
- **Sync mechanism:** real-time (WebSocket, push), eventual (polling, next request), manual (user must change on each surface)
- **Worker and cron jobs:** do background processes that run outside user sessions check consent state before processing?
- **Race conditions:** can a user withdraw consent on the web while the extension is mid-evaluation using the old consent state?

Flag any surface that processes personal data without checking the current consent state.

### Step 7: Compile Report

Aggregate findings from Steps 1-6 into the Consent Flow Report format below. Assign severity and confidence to each finding. The Consent Enforcement Map (Step 4) is the primary artifact — present it as a separable section that can be extracted and maintained independently.

| **LOW** | Copy clarity improvement, minor friction asymmetry, documentation gap |

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Definition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **HIGH** | Script load order visible, enforcement point present or absent, click count measurable | Finding can be acted on directly |
| **MEDIUM** | Legal basis determination, partial code visibility, dark pattern requires judgment | Review recommended before acting |
| **LOW** | Visual-only dark pattern, runtime-dependent behaviour, third-party SDK internals | Consult privacy professional or conduct manual UI review |

## Jurisdiction Notes

**Default (principle-based):** Assess consent mechanisms against the core principle that valid consent requires a free, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes. This standard is broadly shared across GDPR, LGPD, and principle-based frameworks.

**GDPR (Art. 4(11), Art. 7):** Apply four cumulative conditions, "freely given" per EDPB 05/2020 (conditionality, granularity, detriment, power imbalance), Art. 7(3) withdrawal symmetry, ePrivacy Art. 5(3) strictly necessary test. Key case law: Planet49 (C-673/17, pre-checked boxes), Orange România (C-61/19, bundled consent), Fashion ID (C-40/17, joint controllership). See `shared/jurisdiction-profiles.md`.

**CCPA/CPRA:** Requires "Do Not Sell or Share" opt-out mechanism (§1798.120) covering both sale and sharing. Minors under 16 require opt-in (§1798.120(c)/(d)). See `shared/jurisdiction-profiles.md`.

**LGPD (Art. 8):** Mirrors GDPR Art. 7. Art. 8(4) additionally requires consent authorisations presented with prominence, distinct from other contractual clauses.
